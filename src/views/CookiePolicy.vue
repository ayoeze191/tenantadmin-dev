        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used to
          make websites work efficiently and to provide reporting information.

        </p>

        <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some

          referred to as
          <strong>essential cookies</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other cookies help us understand user behavior, enhance user
          experience, provide analytics, and deliver advertising. These purposes
